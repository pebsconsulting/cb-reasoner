CB is an experimental reasoner for ontologies based
on a new kind of "consequence-based" reasoning procedure.

Currently CB supports a fragment of [OWL 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/) which corresponds
to the DL Horn-SHIF.

The theory behind the reasoner and some encouraging experiment results are described in [this paper](http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication3140-abstract.html).
